A simple terminal based interface for chatgpt. I have attempted to mimic
the playgrounds current implementation as closely as possible. in order to use
the script you will need an api key for chatgpt.

You can get one here https://openai.com/api/

set your api key to the enviroment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
